<h2>Healthy Kids - Whatever It Takes</h2>
<br>
<div class="our_vision"
<p>The work of Sydney Children’s Hospitals Foundation has never been more critical.
<br>
<br>
With a rapid rise in the demand for - and cost of - clinical care for children, due to population growth, changing demographics, inflation and budget constraints, we know we need to be innovative in how we operate and agile in how we respond.
<br>
<br>
This is particularly relevant when considering the changing philanthropic environment we are facing, including generational differences in donor motivation, needs and expectations.
<br>
<br>
We are working towards a world where every child has access to the best healthcare, when and where they need it, and to achieve our vision we want to involve the entire community in bringing it to life.
